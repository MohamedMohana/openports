Title: [Tool] OpenPorts v1.1.6 - Finally fixed the preferences bug! macOS menu bar app for port monitoring

Body:

Hey r/macdev, just released a fix for the preferences window bug in OpenPorts.

**Why you need this:**
Ever had port conflicts? "Port 3000 is already in use"? With OpenPorts, you can:

1. Click menu bar icon → See ALL open ports instantly
2. Right-click any port → See process name, PID, uptime
3. Terminate problematic processes in 2 clicks

**Dev-friendly features:**
- ⚡ Lightning bolt badge on new processes (last 5 min)
- 🔴 Safety ratings so you don't kill system services
- 📂 Project name detection (shows "survey-kku" instead of just "python")
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 3/5/10/30s or manual
- 🚀 Launch at login for always-on monitoring

**Tech Stack:**
- Swift 6 + SwiftUI
- Native macOS APIs (lsof, Accessibility)
- Modular architecture (OpenPortsCore + OpenPorts app)

**Install:**
```bash
brew install --cask MohamedMohana/tap/openports
```

Open source: https://github.com/MohamedMohana/openports

Feedback and PRs welcome! 🙏

Title: OpenPorts: macOS menu bar app for monitoring local ports and processes (v1.1.6 released)

**v1.1.6 fixes:**
Fixed the preferences window bug where users couldn't access settings.

**Installation:**
```bash
brew install --cask MohamedMohana/tap/openports
```

If you're a dev who works with ports (React, Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.), this will save you time. ⭐️ if you find it useful!

Title: Show HN: OpenPorts - macOS menu bar app for monitoring local ports and processes

Text:

Hi HN,

I built OpenPorts to solve the frustrating "which process is using port 3000?" problem on macOS.

What it does:
- Shows all open listening ports in the menu bar
- Displays which process/app owns each port
- Color-coded safety ratings (Critical/Important/Optional/User-Created)
- Process termination (graceful or force kill)
- Project name detection for dev tools

Just released v1.1.6 with a fixed Preferences UI that includes:
- Auto-refresh settings (Manual or 3/5/10/30s)
- View options (Group by process/category/app)
- Safety settings (Kill warning levels)
- Advanced features (Port history, Launch at login)

Why I built it:
As a developer, I constantly run multiple dev servers (React, Node.js, Python, Docker). Port conflicts and "already in use" errors were annoying. I built OpenPorts to instantly see what's using each port and terminate problematic processes.

Tech: Swift 6 + SwiftUI, native macOS APIs (lsof, Accessibility), modular architecture.

Install: `brew install --cask MohamedMohana/tap/openports`

Feedback and PRs welcome! 🙏

PS: If you find it useful, a ⭐️ would be amazing (working on GitHub achievements)!

- Process name, PID, and uptime
- Safety ratings (so you don't kill system services by accident)
- Project name for dev tools (shows "survey-kku" instead of just "python")
